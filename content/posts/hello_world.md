2017 has been the most intense year in my life so far.   
Taught me a hell lot of new things.   
Things went wrong in ways I had never even thought of. And things started to get right again after I learned to focus on the right things.   
Now I know..   

_Things go wrong for a reason._   

I'm more awake and less day dreaming.   
More realistic, yet optimistic.  
I'm alive.

# println!("Hello World!");
